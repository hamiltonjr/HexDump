# HexDump

This is a free version of a hexadecimal file dump for use in my Reverse Engineering studies. 
Programming it is a trainning, but this tool may be useful. That's why I decided to make it 
available as a free software.

It hasn't none arguments yet. It's just type ./hexdump and tne file name. To compile it:

gcc hexdump.c -o hexdump

To run:

./hexdump <filename>

A interesting test for the program is 

./hexdump hexdump.c

showing hexdump code dumping. The code is sufficient great to offers a great presentation.

A set of test files are available in the project. The users can do their own test files.
The number of bytes in each test file tests limit conditions of the program.
