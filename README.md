# HexDump
This is a free version of a hexadecimal file dump for use in my Reverse Engineering studies. Programming it is a trainning, but this tool may be useful.  
That's why I decided to make it available.

It hasn't none arguments yet. It's just type ./hexdump and tne file name. I made a makefile available for compilation convenience.
