# HexDump

This is a free version of a hexadecimal file dump for use in my Reverse Engineering studies. 
Programming it is a trainning, but this tool may be useful. That's why I decided to make it 
available as a free software.

It hasn't none arguments yet. It's just type ./hexdump and tne file name. To compile it:

gcc hexdump.c -o hexdump

To run:

./hexdump <filename>

A set of test files are available in the project. The users can do their own test files.
The number of bytes in each test file tests limit conditions of the program.

Contributors are welcome. Use the default Pull Request GitHub method to contribute.
